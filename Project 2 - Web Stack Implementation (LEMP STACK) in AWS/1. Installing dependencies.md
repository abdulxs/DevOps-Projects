At the prompt, enter Y to confirm that you want to install Nginx. This would complete the installation process.

To confirm that nginx was successfully installed and is running as a service in Ubuntu, run: sudo systemctl status nginx

Green indicator shows that the server was successfully install and running.

The server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet. 

But, to access it from the internet port 80 must be open to allow traffic from the internet in.

To test that the server can be accessed locally from the instance run the curl command: curl http://localhost:80 


The output shows that the server is accessible from the local host.

To test that the server can be accessed from the internet, open a browser and type the following url with the public IP of your Ubuntu instance; http://Public-IP-Address:80

Run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. 

This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. 

Run the follwing command: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';

Run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. run the follwing command: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';

Exit SQL shell by typing exit

Start interactive scripting to configure the validate password pluggin. Run: sudo mysql_secure_installation and answer Y to all the prompts. At the point you can change the password of your root user and also decide the level of password validation.

When done, test to know if login to the console is possible. type: sudo mysql -p

This would prompt you to enter root user password. Enter the choosen password and enter.

type exit to exit MySQL console.


INSTALLING PHP

Steps

PHP has to be installed to process code and generate dynamic content for the web server.

Nginx requires an external program to handle PHP processing and act as a bridge between the PHP interpreter itself and the web server. 

This allows for a better overall performance in most PHP-based websites, but it requires additional configuration. 

You’ll need to install php-fpm, which stands for “PHP fastCGI process manager”, and tell Nginx to pass PHP requests to this software for processing. 

Additionally, you’ll need php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases. 

Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies.

To install the 2 pacakages at once, run: sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql

Type Y to confirm installation and enter.
